# 1. What is Node.js ? Is it a Framework or any Language ?
 Node.js is neither a framework ,nor any language . It is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JS code to executed on the SERVER side. 
 Browsers executes JS code on the CLIENT Side ( eg : v8 engiene of Chrome ) and Node.js executes JS code on the server side . Node.js is basically built on the v8 engiene of Chrome .

# 2. What is the difference between a Runtime Env and Framerwork ? 
  Runtime Environments basically provides the necessary infrastruture for code execution ( by converting -> High Level Language to Machine Level Language ) and also provide some basic facilities 
  like memory management , I/O operations . 
  On the other hand , a Framework is always built on the top of any language , it provides the necessary facilities for development puroposes by providing a lot of tools, in built libraires etc.
  E.g : Node.js is a runtime environment and Express.js is a framework . Node.js provides a platform for javascript code execution whereas Express.js is a framework which is built on the top of Javascript language
  and uses node.js as a runtime environment .

# 3. What is the difference between Client Side and Server Side ?
  Client Side is mainly the browser . It's runtime environment is mainly the Browser whereas the runtime environment of Server side is the Server . Client side handles all the UI and rendering logic wherease the 
  server side handles all the buisness logic like Database , authentication & authorization . Client side does not contain any REQUEST / RESPONSE object but the server side contains REQUEST / RESPONSE object .
  Client side contains WINDOW / DOCUMENT MANIPULATION objects but the server side does not contain them .
